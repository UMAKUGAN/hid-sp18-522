## Usage of Files and Data Structures using rest services hid-sp18-522

* Pandas (open source, BSD-licensed library providing
  high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis
  tools for the Python programming language) is used to
  manipulate the Iris dataset available on

* This Iris dataset contains 150 instances with 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.


* Three API endpoints are provided.

  * ```/Iris/Download```
  
  * ```/Iris/categories```
  
  * ```/Iris/categories/categoryname```
