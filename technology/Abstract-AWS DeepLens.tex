\begin{abstract}

AWS DeepLens is the world's first video camera optimized to run machine learning models and perform inference on the device. It comes with 6 sample projects at launch, that you can deploy to your AWS DeepLens in less than 10 minutes. You can run the sample projects as is, connect them with other AWS services, train a model in Amazon Sagemaker and deploy it to AWS DeepLens, or extend the functionality by triggering a lambda function when an action takes place. You can even apply more advanced analytics on the cloud using Amazon Kinesis Video Streams and Amazon Rekognition video. AWS DeepLens provides the building blocks for your machine learning needs.\cite{ref:deeplens}\hfill\break
